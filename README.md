## Description

This project is refactoring of an e-commerce platform from React Context to Legacy Redux, i.e. Redux prior to Toolkit.

The technologies used in this application are:

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/testing)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

### User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
